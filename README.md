# Project 2: Regression
Using web scraping techniques to gather housing data for  regression analysis


## Backstory:

Using information we scrape from the web, build linear regression models from which we can learn about movies, sports, or categories.

### Data:

 * **acquisition**: web scraping
 * **storage**: flat files
 * **sources**: (as listed below or any other publicly available information)   
  - movie: boxofficemojo.com, imdb.com   
  - sports: sports-reference.com
  
 * **data**: a rough rule of thumb is to aim for 1000+ data points and 10+ features, and you should make sure that you have a **continuous, numerical target** variable to predict (e.g. revenue, price, # views, salary, etc.). 1000+ data points is good to aim for to make the model more robust, and 10+ features is good to aim for to make the modeling/feature engineering/feature selection you can do more interesting and challenging -- but it's fine to break this rule of thumb if you've found an interesting dataset with enough depth to work through (e.g. only a few hundred records, but many or interesting features). 
  

### Skills:

 * basics of the web (requests, HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
 * web scraping
 * `numpy` and `pandas`
 * `statsmodels`, `scikit-learn`


### Analysis:

 * linear regression is required, other regression methods are optional


## Deliverable/communication:

 * Project proposal: short description (site and problem) via slack, **Wed/Thurs of Week 2**
 * Alternatively (or in addition), check in discussion with an instructor by **Thurs of Week 2** 
 * Minimum Viable Product (MVP): **Tues of Week 3**   
 * Slide presentation: **5 minutes, Friday of Week 3**


### Design:

 * iterative design process
 * "MVP"s and building outward
 * [stand-ups/scrums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)) (1 minute progress updates to the class)


## More information:

We'll learn about web scraping using two popular tools - BeautifulSoup and Selenium. You must know the very basics of HTML. We can also evolve the way we use Jupyter notebooks; during this project, we begin to use the notebook as a development scratchpad, where we test things out through interactive scripting, but then solidify our work in python modules with reusable functions and classes.

We'll practice using linear regression. We'll have a first taste of feature selection, this time based on our intuition and some trial and error, and we'll build and refine our models.

This project will give you the freedom to challenge yourself, no matter your skill level. Find your boundaries and push them a little further. We are very excited to see what you will learn and do for Project Luther!
